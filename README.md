# Welcome!

This is a project I had started at the end of my Java class from FCC CIT63 during Fall 2023. This is a simple Calendar program created for the sole purpose of making sure you can keep track of your future schedule and timing. The goal is to create an advance time/date system implemented with the use of Toedter's jCalendar.

Language: Java | Program template: jCalendar by Toedter.

How to use - Extract rar file into IDE Project folder

Patch Notes:

v004> 1-2-2024
- Fixed error where Day planner notes was combined with timer causing error on loading timer

v003> 1-2-2024
- Added note and datastore for day planner

v002> 12-25-2023
- fix bugged timer (no load after start listener; needed renew for refresh time rate)

v001> 12-19-2023
- Added timer function start/stop


(NOTE: This is also a showcase of me learning how to use the time imports, functions and libraries.)
